# Online-Course-Recommendation-System

Built on data fetched from Pluralsight's course API fetched results.
Works with model trained on K-means unsupervised clustering algorithm on text data vectorized tf-idf algorithm.

# To Get Started

1. Extract out the `finalized_model.zip` stored model's zip file first. As, it will be used by `recommend_util.py` file.
2. Extract out the `courses.csv` file. As, it will be used by `recommend_util.py` file for loading the data.
2. Simply, execute 'python3 recommend_util.py'. It will return results for some pre-loaded queries that are already
inserted in this file.

# Training Model

1. Run command 'python3 model_train.py' for training the k-means model and storing it.

# Requirements

Make sure python(3.x), pandas, sklearn, pickle, numpy are present your system for running this module.

# Kudos !!
